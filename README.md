This project involved a multi-faceted approach combining data science and film studies. Here are the key components:

Data Collection and Preprocessing: Sourced a comprehensive dataset of Hollywood films. Cleaned and structured the data for analysis, requiring meticulous data handling skills.

Application of the Bechdel Test: Utilized the Bechdel Test to assess films, which involves evaluating whether a work features at least two women who talk to each other about something other than a man.

Statistical Analysis and Data Visualization: Performed in-depth statistical analysis to identify trends and disparities. Used data visualization tools to present findings in an understandable and impactful manner.

Natural Language Processing (NLP): Applied NLP techniques to analyze film dialogues and scripts, determining the context and depth of female characters' conversations.

Machine Learning: Employed machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of a film passing the Bechdel Test based on various factors like genre, director, and cast.

Cultural and Film Industry Insights: Integrated analysis with knowledge of film industry trends and cultural context, essential for interpreting data correctly.

Programming and Software Proficiency: Required strong proficiency in programming languages like Python or R, and tools like pandas, scikit-learn, NLTK, and visualization libraries (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn).

Critical Thinking and Analytical Skills: Essential for drawing meaningful conclusions from complex data sets.

This project not only showcased technical prowess in data science but also contributed valuable insights into gender representation in the film industry, emphasizing the need for diversity and equality in Hollywood narratives.
